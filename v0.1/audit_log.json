However, it has been widely reported that Henri Colette and Andrew Wiles were awarded for their contributions to number theory. This information might need further confirmation as the official list only includes Edward Witten (for fundamental accomplishments within mathematical and physical physics).",

The Nobel Prize in Mathematics does not exist as such; the closest is the Fields Medal, awarded for outstanding mathematical work and given for the first time in 1936."
